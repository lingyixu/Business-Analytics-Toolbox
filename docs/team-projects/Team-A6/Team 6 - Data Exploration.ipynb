# **Avoiding Flight Delays out of Boston**
# 
# Xinman Liu, Melissa Putur, Jiao Sun, Adil Bin Wahab, Rui Xu

# **Project Overview:** Boston Logan airport is the largest airport in New England with over 100,000 domestic flights annually. While the airport does offer exceptional ocean views and dining options, ie Dunkin Donuts, delayed and canceled flights can create financial and emotional burdens for passengers like increased trip costs and missed work or vacation days. To maximize our trips and avoid flight delays and/or cancellations out of Boston Logan we will explore which airlines, departure times, and destinations experience the fewest disruptions.  

# **Data:** To explore our question above we downloaded 3 datasets related to domestic flights in the United States in 2015. The full datasets can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/version/1#flights.csv
# 
# **Dataset 1 - Flights:** The flights dataset contains a row for every domestic flight in the United States in 2015. The original file contained 5.8 million rows and was 1.1 GB. After uploading the file into Big Query, we ran a query to capture only flights that departed out of Boston to increase query processesing time and reduce the amount of money we needed to pay per query. Our updated dataset contained 107,817 rows and was 20 MB. We used the following columns for our analysis. Note: There was no data available for flights out of Boston in October in this dataset. 
# - Year - year of the flight; a nullable integer; only includes data from 2015 
# - Month - month of the flight; a nullable integer
# - Day - day of the flight; a nullable integer
# - Airline - code of the airline; a nullable string
# - Flight_number - flight number; a nullable integer
# - Origin_airport - the departing airport; a nullable string; identical to the IATA_CODE column from the airport table  
# - Destination_airport - the destination airport; a nullable string; identical to the IATA_CODE column from the airport table  
# - Departure_delay - the departure delay time in minutes; a nullable integer
# 
# Below is sample of the raw data from this table:

# In[48]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('bq', 'query', 'SELECT\n  YEAR,\n  MONTH\n  DAY,\n  AIRLINE,\n  FLIGHT_NUMBER,\n  ORIGIN_AIRPORT,\n  DESTINATION_AIRPORT,\n  DEPARTURE_DELAY\nFROM\n`team6-770.flight_data.bos_flights_only`\nLIMIT 5')


# **Dataset 2 - Airlines:** The airline dataset contains two columns, the name of the 14 airlines with domestic flights within the U.S. in 2015 and their airline codes and 15 rows. Because the flights dataset did not contain full airline names, we had to join the airlines table to the flights table by airline code to reference airline names. The following columns were availble in the airlines dataset:
# - Airline_name - the full name of the airline; a nullable string
# - IATA_code - the associated code with the airline; a nullable string
# 
# Below is a sample of the raw data from this table:

# In[49]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('bq', 'query', 'SELECT\n*\nFROM\n`team6-770.flight_data.airlines`\nORDER BY STRING_FIELD_0\nLIMIT 5')


# **Dataset 3 - Airports:** The airports table contains seven columns and 322 rows. Because the flights dataset did not contain full airport name or destination city, we used the IATA_CODE column to join to the flights table and capture this information. We used the following columns from the flights dataset:
# - IATA_code - the associated code with the airport; a nullable string
# - Airport - full name of the airport; a nullable string 
# - City - name of the city the airport is in; a nullable string
# - State - name of the state the airport is in; a nullable string
# - Country - name of the country the airport is in; a nullable string
#

# **Data Exploration**

# **Question:** How many cities can you fly to from Boston?

# **Question:** What are the most popular destinations from Boston?
# 
# The most popular destinations in 2015 were Ronald Reagan Airport (7,687 flights), LaGuardia Airport (7,096 flights), and Chicago O'Hare (6,551 flights).

# **Question:** How many flights are out of Boston each month?
# 
# Throughout the year there were between 8,300 and 10,800 flights out of Boston each month. January had the least amount of flights, with 8,837 while July had the most flights with 10,837. In general the winter months were the least busy while the summer months were the most busy.

# **Question:** Which destinations had highest percentage of delayed flights?
# 
# The city with the most delayed flights was Madison, with 100% of flights to Madison in 2015 being delayed. Upon further investigation though, there was only 1 flight to Madison so the statistic appears more extreme than it is. In fact, the top 3 most delayed destinations had less than 1 flight a day routed for that destination. For destinations with more than one flight scheduled per day, San Francisco, San Juan, and Denver experienced the highest delay rate with 58%, 58%, and 56% of flights delayed respectively.

#  
# In 2015, Jetblue Airways had by far the most flights out of Boston with a total of 37,962 flights and making up 35% of all flights out of Boston. Skywest Airlines had the least amount of flights from Boston, with only 258 for the year.

# 
# United had the highest percentage of flights delayed with a 56% delay rate. Skywest and American Airlines had the lowest percentage of delayed flights with 26% of their flights in 2015 experiencing delays.

# **Question:** What airline had the longest delays on average?
# 
# While Atlantic Southeast had the 3rd lowest delay rate of all the airlines, their flights that did have delays experienced the longest delays on average with an average delay time of 44 minutes. Virgin America flights experienced the lowest average delay time at 27 minutes.

# **Question:** Which season has the most flight delays?
# 
# From the output, we can clearly see that winter had the highest delay rate, with 41% of flights delayed. The most likely reason for this is the high frequency of snow and extremely cold weather in winter in Boston. Surprisingly, the flight delay rate for summer, 39%,  is only 1% lower than that in winter, and the most possible reason is that hot air makes it harder for flights to fly because the density of the hot air itself will be thinner. By contract, Fall has the lowest flight delay rate, which is 29.4%. In summary, there are differences in delay rates between seasons.

# In[62]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('bq', 'query -n season_by_perc_of_flights_delayed', "SELECT\n  SEASON,\n  ROUND((delayed/total_flights),3) AS PERC_OF_FLIGHTS_DELAYED\nFROM (\n  SELECT\n    COUNT(*) AS total_flights,\n    CASE\n      WHEN MONTH IN (1, 2, 12) THEN 'WINTER'\n      WHEN MONTH IN (3,4,5) THEN 'SPRING'\n      WHEN MONTH IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'SUMMER'\n    ELSE\n    'FALL'\n  END\n    AS SEASON,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN departure_delay >0 THEN 1\n      ELSE 0\n    END) AS delayed\n  FROM\n    `team6-770.flight_data.bos_flights_only`\n  GROUP BY 2) AS subquery\nORDER BY\n  perc_of_flights_delayed DESC")

# **Question:** Which holiday season has the most flight delays?
# 
# Note: To explore this question, and all questions related to holidays, we looked at the days leading up to each holiday because we know most people will fly the couple of days leading up to a holiday rather than on the actual holiday. 
# 
# We can see that the delayed percentage of flights around Christmas was higher than any other holiday. This was likely because of the increase of tourists, students leaving school and generally more crowded flights. In addition, Christmas is in the winter time where there is as greater chance of delay because of snow. By contrast, the percentage of delays for the other four holidays was lower than a typical day.

# **Question:** What are the top 5 most popular destinations by season and holiday?
# 
# Boston is known for having a very diverse and young demographic with individuals from every corner of the country and outside the country attracted to the rich academic and professional work culture. As flying to different corners of the country for short holidays has become very convenient, we wanted to explore the most popular destinations during different holidays of the year. As expected the most flights out of Boston are around the Christmas and New Years period compared to any other major holidays (such as Thanksgiving, Labor Day, and Memorial Day). Chicago is the most popular destination during the Christmas/New Years, followed by Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Baltimore. For Thanksgiving, Arlington, VA appears to be a significantly more popular destination, followed by Chicago. Similarly, Arlington and Chicago are the most popular destinations for Memorial Day and Labor Day, with Chicago being the most popular for Labor Day and Arlington for Memorial Day. 
# Given the fact that Arlington and Chicago are top domestic destinations from Boston Logan during Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, and Labor Day, it is not a surprise that these two cities are also the most popular destinations in the Summer and Fall. In the Winter and Spring, New York, Chicago and Arlington are the most popular destinations, with remarkably more flights to New York in the Winter. Refer to the tables below for the top 5 most popular destinations by seasons and holidays. The popularity of these airports may be partly explained by the fact that they are all large international airports that are popular for connecting flights.

# - Afternoon: 12:00 PM - 4:59 PM
# - Evening: 5:00 PM - 1:30 AM
# 
# Almost half of all flights out of Boston are in the morning. About 25% of flights are scheduled for both the afternoon and evening. There were no flights scheduled between 2 AM and 5 AM out of Boston in 2015.

# **Summary**
# 
# Our project investigated flight delays out of Boston Logan International Airport for domestic flights in 2015 to identify the most time-efficient trips for travelers from Boston. By summarizing and organizing the original dataset, we examined the relationships between flight delays out of Boston with destination, airline, time of day, season and holiday.
#  
# In 2015 flights from Boston departed to 59 cities within the United States. The destinations with the highest delay rates were Dallas (65%), Sacramento (59%), and San Francisco (58%). Madison did have the highest delay rate with 100% of flights delayed, but there was only one flight to Madison in 2015 so the sample size did not make it noteworthy enough to include in our top destination delays list.
